Towers of Hanoi based sonification.

This an interactive implementation of the Towers of Hanoi.
Click on towers to select the top most disc, click another tower to move it.

Use the solve button to watch an animation of the solution from the starting position.

Use the ii-V-I button to hear a fully stacked tower individually on each post in succession.

Each of the disks also has an oscillator attached which represents a harmonic (or subharmonic) partial of the tower on which it is placed.

The first tower is a subharmonic series over a G.
The second tower is a harmonic series over a G.
The third tower is a harmonic series over C.

This is could also be considered a ii-V-I progression.
